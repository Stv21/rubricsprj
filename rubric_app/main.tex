\section{Introduction}
Education assessment has evolved significantly with the advent of technology, yet many institutions still rely on manual grading methods. Rubric-based grading, while effective, is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. "Rubric-Ease" automates this process by detecting marks from rubric sheets and storing them in a digital database. The project leverages image processing, machine learning, and web technologies to create a robust assessment platform.

The manual rubric-based assessment process involves several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time-intensive evaluation procedures for large classes
    \item Inconsistency in evaluations due to human factors like fatigue
    \item Difficulties in tracking student progress over time
    \item Limited accessibility to assessment data for stakeholders
    \item Challenges in providing timely feedback to students
\end{itemize}

Digital transformation of education has gained momentum, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the need for remote learning solutions. However, assessment systems have not kept pace with this transformation. Most existing digital assessment tools either focus on multiple-choice questions or require manual input of rubric scores.

The main objectives of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a web-based platform for rubric-based grading.
    \item To use image processing for extracting marks from rubric sheets.
    \item To create a dynamic teacher-student dashboard for results visualization.
    \item To ensure accuracy and fairness in the evaluation process.
    \item To provide actionable analytics for educational improvement.
    \item To reduce the administrative burden on teaching staff.
\end{itemize}

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 describes the methodology, Section 4 presents the system architecture, Section 5 details the implementation process, Section 6 provides results and analysis, Section 7 discusses challenges and limitations, and Section 8 concludes the study with future directions.

\section{Literature Review}
Several studies have explored automated assessment systems. Prior research highlights:

\subsection{Computer Vision in Education}
Computer vision technologies have been increasingly applied to educational contexts. Systems like OCR-based grading tools have demonstrated efficiency in extracting handwritten text from answer sheets. Singh and Kumar (2022) developed an OCR system that could recognize handwritten answers with 85\% accuracy, significantly reducing evaluation time. Similarly, Zhang et al. (2021) proposed a vision-based system for analyzing student diagrams and drawings, achieving 78\% accuracy in assessment alignment with expert evaluators.

Research by Patel and Joshi (2023) focused specifically on table structure recognition, a crucial component for rubric detection. Their approach using Mask R-CNN achieved a 92\% accuracy in identifying complex table structures, providing a foundation for rubric cell detection.

\subsection{Machine Learning for Evaluation}
Various AI-based grading mechanisms have been proposed to reduce human biases. Nguyen et al. (2022) demonstrated that deep learning models could evaluate essay quality with correlation coefficients of 0.85 with human graders. Wang and Li (2021) applied transformer models to evaluate programming assignments, showing potential for automated code assessment.

In the context of subjective evaluations, Rodriguez and Smith (2023) explored the use of decision trees and ensemble methods to mimic expert grading patterns. Their approach achieved 82\% agreement with human evaluators on a corpus of engineering project reports.

\subsection{Rubric-Based Grading Models}
Institutions have developed digital rubrics, but most require manual input. Johnson and Peterson (2022) designed a digital rubric framework that reduced grading time by 45\%, though it still required manual marking. Thomson et al. (2021) implemented a collaborative rubric platform that allowed multiple evaluators to grade simultaneously, improving consistency but not addressing the time constraints.

The Canvas LMS and similar platforms offer digital rubric tools, but as noted by Alvarez et al. (2022), these systems lack automation for paper-based rubrics that many institutions still use. Kim and Park (2023) identified that hybrid approaches—combining physical rubric sheets with digital processing—could serve as an effective transition strategy for institutions adapting to fully digital assessment.

While these solutions have shown promise, none integrate an end-to-end solution for fully automating rubric-based evaluation. "Rubric-Ease" aims to bridge this gap by providing a comprehensive system that handles the entire workflow from physical rubric sheet scanning to digital storage and analytics.

\section{Methodology}
The implementation of "Rubric-Ease" follows a structured approach combining image processing, machine learning, and web development methodologies.

\subsection{Dataset Collection}
To ensure robust model training, we collected an extensive dataset consisting of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 1,200+ rubric sheets from 15 different courses
    \item Variations in marking styles from 25 instructors
    \item Different rubric layouts including 4-point, 5-point, and 10-point scales
    \item Samples with various marking methods (checkmarks, circles, crosses)
\end{itemize}

Data preprocessing involved a multi-step approach:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Converting images to grayscale to reduce complexity
    \item Applying adaptive thresholding to account for different lighting conditions
    \item Detecting table boundaries using Hough transform techniques
    \item Identifying marks based on pixel intensity and structural patterns
    \item Normalizing image scale and orientation using perspective transforms
\end{itemize}

To ensure data quality, we implemented a validation process where 20\% of preprocessed images were manually verified by two independent reviewers. Discrepancies were resolved through consultation with a third expert.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Processing time for each stage of the image preprocessing pipeline}
    \label{fig:preprocessing}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Image Processing}
Our image processing pipeline incorporates several computer vision techniques:

\subsubsection{Edge Detection}
OpenCV's Canny edge detector was used to find grid lines in the rubric sheets. The algorithm parameters were empirically optimized for rubric detection:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Lower threshold: 50
    \item Upper threshold: 150
    \item Aperture size: 3
\end{itemize}

The edge detection was followed by morphological operations to clean up the detected edges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Dilation to connect nearby edge fragments
    \item Erosion to remove noise
    \item Opening and closing operations to improve line continuity
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Contour Analysis}
Marks were detected by identifying high-density ink regions using contour analysis. The approach involved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Contour detection using OpenCV's findContours() function
    \item Filtering contours based on area, aspect ratio, and solidity
    \item Classification of contour types (checkmark, circle, cross)
    \item Localization of contours within the rubric grid
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:contour_analysis} demonstrates the contour detection process on a sample rubric cell.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Contour detection process for mark identification in rubric cells}
    \label{fig:contour_analysis}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Template Matching}
A reference rubric template was used to align images and ensure consistent cell extraction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Template matching using normalized cross-correlation
    \item Homography computation for perspective correction
    \item Grid cell extraction based on template coordinates
    \item Dynamic adjustment for variable rubric layouts
\end{itemize}

The template matching process achieved 96\% accuracy in correctly identifying rubric structures across different formats.

\subsection{Machine Learning Model}
We employed a combination of deep learning and classical machine learning approaches:

\subsubsection{YOLOv5 for Object Detection}
YOLOv5-based object detection was trained to recognize checkmarks, circles, crosses, and numbers in rubric cells:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training set: 900 annotated rubric sheets
    \item Validation set: 200 rubric sheets
    \item Test set: 100 rubric sheets
    \item Data augmentation techniques: rotation, scaling, perspective transforms
    \item Training parameters: 150 epochs, batch size 16, learning rate 0.001
\end{itemize}

The model achieved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 98.2\% mean Average Precision (mAP) for mark detection
    \item 95.7\% accuracy in classifying mark types
    \item 240ms average inference time per rubric sheet
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Mark Detection and Classification}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{ProcessRubricImage}{$image$}
    \State $preprocessed \gets$ PreprocessImage($image$)
    \State $cells \gets$ ExtractRubricCells($preprocessed$)
    \State $results \gets \emptyset$
    \For{each $cell$ in $cells$}
        \State $features \gets$ ExtractFeatures($cell$)
        \State $markType \gets$ ClassifyMark($features$)
        \State $score \gets$ AssignScore($markType$, $cell.position$)
        \State $results \gets results \cup \{cell.position, score\}$
    \EndFor
    \State \Return $results$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{SVM Classifier}
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were employed for distinguishing filled versus unfilled rubric cells:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
    \item Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
    \item Hyperparameter optimization using grid search with 5-fold cross-validation
    \item Ensemble approach combining multiple SVM models for robustness
\end{itemize}

The SVM classifier achieved 97.3\% accuracy in binary classification of filled vs. unfilled cells and was particularly robust to variations in marking styles.

\section{System Architecture}
The system architecture follows a modular design with three primary components: frontend interface, backend processing, and the AI processing module. Figure \ref{fig:system_architecture} illustrates the overall architecture.

\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{Editor_Mermaid_Chart-2025-03-28-160738.png}
    \caption{Comprehensive system architecture of Rubric-Ease showing data flow between components}
    \label{fig:system_architecture}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Frontend: Student-Teacher Dashboard}
Built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, the dashboard provides tailored interfaces for different user roles:

\subsubsection{Teacher Interface}
The teacher dashboard offers comprehensive functionality:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Rubric sheet upload and batch processing
    \item Real-time visualization of processed results
    \item Manual override capability for AI-detected marks
    \item Performance analytics across classes and assignments
    \item Customizable rubric templates and criteria
    \item Automated feedback generation for students
    \item Export options in multiple formats (PDF, Excel, CSV)
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:teacher_dashboard} shows the teacher interface with its key components.

\section{Introduction}
Education assessment has evolved significantly with the advent of technology, yet many institutions still rely on manual grading methods. Rubric-based grading, while effective, is time-consuming and prone to subjectivity. "Rubric-Ease" automates this process by detecting marks from rubric sheets and storing them in a digital database. The project leverages image processing, machine learning, and web technologies to create a robust assessment platform.

The manual rubric-based assessment process involves several challenges:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Time-intensive evaluation procedures for large classes
    \item Inconsistency in evaluations due to human factors like fatigue
    \item Difficulties in tracking student progress over time
    \item Limited accessibility to assessment data for stakeholders
    \item Challenges in providing timely feedback to students
\end{itemize}

Digital transformation of education has gained momentum, particularly after the COVID-19 pandemic, which accelerated the need for remote learning solutions. However, assessment systems have not kept pace with this transformation. Most existing digital assessment tools either focus on multiple-choice questions or require manual input of rubric scores.

The main objectives of this research are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item To develop a web-based platform for rubric-based grading.
    \item To use image processing for extracting marks from rubric sheets.
    \item To create a dynamic teacher-student dashboard for results visualization.
    \item To ensure accuracy and fairness in the evaluation process.
    \item To provide actionable analytics for educational improvement.
    \item To reduce the administrative burden on teaching staff.
\end{itemize}

This paper is structured as follows: Section 2 discusses related work, Section 3 describes the methodology, Section 4 presents the system architecture, Section 5 details the implementation process, Section 6 provides results and analysis, Section 7 discusses challenges and limitations, and Section 8 concludes the study with future directions.

    \end{subfigure}
    \caption{Contour detection process for mark identification in rubric cells}
    \label{fig:contour_analysis}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Template Matching}
A reference rubric template was used to align images and ensure consistent cell extraction:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Template matching using normalized cross-correlation
    \item Homography computation for perspective correction
    \item Grid cell extraction based on template coordinates
    \item Dynamic adjustment for variable rubric layouts
\end{itemize}

The template matching process achieved 96\% accuracy in correctly identifying rubric structures across different formats.

\subsection{Machine Learning Model}
We employed a combination of deep learning and classical machine learning approaches:

\subsubsection{YOLOv5 for Object Detection}
YOLOv5-based object detection was trained to recognize checkmarks, circles, crosses, and numbers in rubric cells:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Training set: 900 annotated rubric sheets
    \item Validation set: 200 rubric sheets
    \item Test set: 100 rubric sheets
    \item Data augmentation techniques: rotation, scaling, perspective transforms
    \item Training parameters: 150 epochs, batch size 16, learning rate 0.001
\end{itemize}

The model achieved:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 98.2\% mean Average Precision (mAP) for mark detection
    \item 95.7\% accuracy in classifying mark types
    \item 240ms average inference time per rubric sheet
\end{itemize}

\begin{algorithm}
\caption{Mark Detection and Classification}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
\Procedure{ProcessRubricImage}{$image$}
    \State $preprocessed \gets$ PreprocessImage($image$)
    \State $cells \gets$ ExtractRubricCells($preprocessed$)
    \State $results \gets \emptyset$
    \For{each $cell$ in $cells$}
        \State $features \gets$ ExtractFeatures($cell$)
        \State $markType \gets$ ClassifyMark($features$)
        \State $score \gets$ AssignScore($markType$, $cell.position$)
        \State $results \gets results \cup \{cell.position, score\}$
    \EndFor
    \State \Return $results$
\EndProcedure
\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

\subsubsection{SVM Classifier}
Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifiers were employed for distinguishing filled versus unfilled rubric cells:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feature extraction: HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients)
    \item Kernel: Radial Basis Function (RBF)
    \item Hyperparameter optimization using grid search with 5-fold cross-validation
    \item Ensemble approach combining multiple SVM models for robustness
\end{itemize}

The SVM classifier achieved 97.3\% accuracy in binary classification of filled vs. unfilled cells and was particularly robust to variations in marking styles.

\section{System Architecture}

    \centering
    \caption{Time comparison between manual and automated rubric processing}
    \label{tab:time_comparison}
    \begin{tabular}{lccc}
        \toprule
        \textbf{Process Step} & \textbf{Manual (min)} & \textbf{Automated (min)} & \textbf{Reduction (\%)} \\
        \midrule
        Mark Identification & 3.5 & 0.02 & 99.4\% \\
